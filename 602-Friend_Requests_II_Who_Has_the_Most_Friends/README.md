# LeetCode Problem 602: Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends

## Problem Description

In a social network, a **friend request** is made when one user sends a request to another user to establish a friendship. 

You are given a list of friend requests where each request is represented by a tuple `(A, B)` meaning that person `A` sent a friend request to person `B`. A user can accept a request only if:
- Both users are not already friends.
- Both users are friends with at least one mutual friend.

Write a SQL query to find the user who has the most friends after all the requests have been processed. If there is a tie, return any of them.

### Table: `Friends`
This table represents the list of friend requests that were made.

| Column Name   | Type   | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `A`           | int    | The user who made the friend request |
| `B`           | int    | The user who received the friend request |
| `RequestTime` | int    | The time the request was made |

### Output

Return the user with the most friends. If there are multiple users with the most friends, return any one of them. The output should contain a single integer representing the user with the most friends.
