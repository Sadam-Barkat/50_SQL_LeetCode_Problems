# Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

## Description
This task involves replacing the Employee ID with a unique identifier across various records in the database or dataset. The purpose is to ensure that every employee has a distinct and unambiguous identifier for identification in the system.

## Objective
To replace the current Employee ID in all records with a unique identifier that is easier to track and manage across different tables or data structures.

## Approach
1. **Identify the Employee ID:** Locate the Employee ID field in the relevant tables or datasets.
2. **Map Employee ID to Unique Identifier:** Create a mapping of Employee IDs to unique identifiers (for example, using UUIDs or other unique schemes).
3. **Replace Employee ID:** Update the database or data structure to use the unique identifier wherever the Employee ID was previously used.

## Steps
1. **Database Query or Script:**
   - Write a SQL script or query to replace the existing Employee ID with a unique identifier.
   - Ensure that any references to the Employee ID across other tables are also updated to the new unique identifier.

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Perform validation checks to ensure that the replacement has been done correctly and that the data remains consistent across all records.

3. **Testing:**
   - Test the system to confirm that the unique identifier is working as expected and that no records have been inadvertently affected.

## Example SQL Query
Here's a basic example of how you might replace Employee IDs with unique identifiers using SQL:

```sql
UPDATE employee_records
SET employee_id = UUID()
WHERE employee_id = 'some_existing_employee_id';
