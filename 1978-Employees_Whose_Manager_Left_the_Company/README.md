# Problem: 1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

## Description

A company has a hierarchy of employees. The employees are represented as a table called `Employee` with the following columns:

- `id`: The unique ID of the employee.
- `name`: The name of the employee.
- `managerId`: The ID of the employeeâ€™s manager. If the employee has no manager, the `managerId` is NULL.

Write a query to find the `id` and `name` of employees whose managers have left the company.

You need to return the result ordered by `id`.

## Example

### Input
```sql
Employee table:
+----+-------+-----------+
